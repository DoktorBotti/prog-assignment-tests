These are tests you can use to verify your assignment letter implementations. Please note that these tests are unofficial. **I do not guarantee that your solution is bug-free, complete and/or will give full points when surpassing 100% of the tests.**

Do not upload any of the files to the Praktomat!

## Assignment 05
1. Download and replace the original Terminal.java with [assignment05/Terminal.java](https://github.com/luk3b/prog-assignment-tests/tree/master/assignment05/Terminal.java)
2. Execute your main class
3. Take a glimpse at your console/terminal

Configuration options:
- Enable colors for ANSI-color compatible Terminals: Open `Terminal.java` and set `CONF_DISABLE_COLORS` to `false`.
- Hide statistics at the end (total tests, pass rate, ..): Open `Terminal.java` and set `CONF_HIDE_STATS` to `true`.

All tests are copied and therefore equal to [DeerMichel/kit-assignment-tests/5-Campus Management](https://github.com/DeerMichel/kit-assignment-tests/tree/master/5-Campus%20Management).
